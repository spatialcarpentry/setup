### Register for an account at iPlant

After completing registration, you'll have access to the following iPlant services: Discovery Environment, My-Plant, iPlant Data Store, iPlant Wiki, TNRS, and Bug and Issue Tracking, and more.

Navigate to <a href="https://user.iplantcollaborative.org/register/" target="_blank">https://user.iplantcollaborative.org/register/</a>.

Registration is simple and straightforward- it requires name, contact information, and institutional information. You'll receive an email confirming your account.

Once created, go to <a href="https://auth.iplantcollaborative.org/cas4/login?service=https://user.iplantcollaborative.org/security/authenticate" target="_blank">iPlant Authentication Service</a> to confirm your account.

Subsequent lessons will utilize the iPlant Data Store: iRods plugin for QGIS requires username and password for connection; spatial layers will be imported into QGIS for lessons.
