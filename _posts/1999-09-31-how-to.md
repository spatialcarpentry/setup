## Lessons

The index of each major topic will explain the overall Obejectives and lists the sub-lessons. Pre-requisites, Objectives, and required Data are listed on each sub-lesson page.

## Recommended Use

Be sure to have installed and configured on your system: QGIS (most recent version) and iRods QGIS plugin. An iPlant account is required for accessing the iPlant Data Store. iRods requires the iPlant account credentials.

For exercises, it's recommended to utilizse the QGIS iRods plugin to load data, rather than from the download links.

Optionally, data will be available with direct download links. For data that is zipped/archived, <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">7-Zip</a> is an example of a simple archiving software. Follow download instructions <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
