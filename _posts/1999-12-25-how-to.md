## Lessons

## Layout

The index of each lesson will explain the overall Obejectives, whereas subtopics will explain Objectives of individual lessons.

Topics are listed on the index of each lesson, as well as on the right horizontal navigation menu. These are numbered and it's highly recommended that these are completed in chronological order.

## Recommended Use

For exercises, it's recommended to download data through the iPlant interface, rather than from the download links. This will aid in the learning process; iteration is great practice.
