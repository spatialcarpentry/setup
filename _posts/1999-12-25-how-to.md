## Lessons

The index of each lesson will explain the overall Obejectives, whereas subtopics will explain Objectives of individual lessons. Pre-requisites to subtopics are listed below the suptopic objectives.

Topics are listed on the index of each lesson, as well as on the right vertical navigation menu. These are numbered and it's highly recommended that these are completed in chronological order.

## Layout

**Right vertical navigation** lists the lessons, in order from top to bottom. Below are the contents or topics of the current lesson directory. Below contents are tags.

## Recommended Use

Begin with **Setup** to install and configure your laptop/computer for exercises. The iPlant account is required for accessing the iPlant Data Store.

For exercises, it's recommended to download data through the iPlant interface, rather than from the download links. This will aid in the learning process; iteration is great practice.
