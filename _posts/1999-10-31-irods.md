## About iRods Plugin

The iRods plugin was developed by Amit Juneja from the BioComputing Facility at the University of Arizona. The plugin allows for:

- a direct connection to any iRODS datastore directly from QGIS
- importing spatial files from iRODS datastore to open map canvas on QGIS
- saving a layer from the map canvas on QGIS to your iRODS datastore account as a spatial file

Supported spatial file types:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Vector: Shapefile (.shp), CSV</td>
<td>Raster: JPEG, GIF, PNG, GeoTIFF, BMP</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> </td><td> </td> </tr>
</table>
