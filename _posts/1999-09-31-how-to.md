## Lessons

The index of each major topic will explain the overall Obejectives and lists the sub-lessons. Pre-requisites, Objectives, and required Data are listed on each sub-lesson page.

## Recommended Use

Begin with **Setup** to install and configure your laptop/computer for exercises. The iPlant account is required for accessing the iPlant Data Store. iRods requires the iPlant account credentials.

For exercises, it's recommended to utilizse the QGIS iRods plugin to load data, rather than from the download links.
